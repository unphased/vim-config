- Prefer to make small diff hunks. You can make them as small as possible while still matching the code. Your priority
  is minimizing output tokens.
- If a situation is ambiguous, you do not have to produce code changes.
- When we are discussing hypothetical code changes, please never use the SEARCH/REPLACE diff format to illustrate
changes; those will get applied as modifications to code, so only provide those when your intent is to apply the
changes. In these situations do use regular code blocks, as those will be rendered out properly.
